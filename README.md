# Object Detection And Tracking
> Contour Tracking Implementation

## Insight to Project

The project used the object detection API to detect the object in a moving video . To track the detected object , 
the contour tracking algorithm was implemented with perspective transform and coordinates of the specific object detected were maintained in a CSV file as it were tracked in different frames . 

## Built With

* [Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection)
* [Open-CV](https://opencv.org/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
